Just, my tasks for X-PYTHON...

## Current Stage

Working on the task for fourth tour...

## How to open?

### Step 1: Cloning repository

> Open terminal/powershell/vs code terminal/cmd/etc.; (Don't close it after this step, you'll need it after)  
> Write `git clone https://github.com/VladIsCatO/X-PYTHON2024.git`;  
> Wait until it clones into a folder "X-PYTHON2024"...
> Write `cd X-PYTHON2024`
> After get to the next step.

### Step 2: Installing requirements

> Write `pip install -r requirements.txt`;  
> Wait until all needed python libraries install...  
> Just go straight to the next step.  

### Step 3: Starting the code/script (idc how you call it)

> Write `python3 <tour_you_want>/<file_you_need>.py`  
> Example for tour 4: `python3 tour4/main.py`
> Work with it! (or if it's a site, pass to the fourth step)

### Step 4: Opening it in browser (you have a browser right?)

**This step is only for tours where i did websites, here is a list of them:**  
**- tour 4.**

## But for tour 3...

You must open server.py before main.py, 'cause server.py is server and main.py is client.
